# Pathfinding with BFS and A*

This project demonstrates pathfinding in a 15x15 grid using:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **A\* Search** with **Manhattan distance** heuristic

## Features

- Reads map data from `.txt` files
- Supports obstacles (`#`) and free cells (`.`)
- Visually shows the path on the map
- Reports:
  - Whether a path was found
  - Path length
  - Nodes explored
  - BFS vs A* efficiency
