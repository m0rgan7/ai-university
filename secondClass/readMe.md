# KNN Exercises in Python

This project explores the implementation and evaluation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using Python and the scikit-learn library.

The exercises cover:

- Basic KNN model training and evaluation on customer churn data
- Investigating the impact of different values of **k** on model performance
- Applying KNN to an industrial quality control dataset with feature importance analysis
